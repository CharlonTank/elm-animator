# Examples

Hello and welcome to `elm-animator`!

Your first step is to read the high-level overview of how this library works in the `README.md`.

Then, we can dig in to some examples. 

  - *examples/Checkbox.elm* - A simple checkbox with a few animated parts.  This example is here to get you started and familiar with the standard concepts.


  - *examples/Pages.elm* - Page transitions.
        
    This covers how you can do seamless page transitions, including updating the url.


  - *examples/Todo.elm* -> 
    Animating a todo list by shuffling completed items to the bottom.

    This is tricky because we have to first ask the browser for bounding boxes.

  - *examples/Mario.elm

    Animate sprites for mario!

  - *examples/Weather.elm*
